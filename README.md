1. **Install BrowseGraph**  
   Add BrowseGraph to your Chrome browser with a single click. No complicated setups.

2. **Start Browsing**  
   BrowseGraph works silently in the background, connecting every page you visit into a dynamic visual network.

3. **Search and Ask**  
   Access all your knowledge seamlessly. Instantly search, navigate, and discover information whenever you need it.


## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Local-First Processing**: All AI computations are performed locally within your browser using in-browser LLMs.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Graphing**: Automatically capture and organize everything you browse into a visual knowledge network.
- **Smart Content Filtering**: Filters out irrelevant pages based on your interests.
- **Efficient Summarization**: Summarizes and indexes page content for quick access.
- **Graph-Based Insights**: Creates and stores graph data to enhance content recommendations.
- **Blazingly Fast Retrieval**: Retrieve any piece of your browsed content instantly with powerful search and intuitive navigation.

    %% Participants
    participant Extension as Chrome Extension
    participant Personalizer as User Content Personalizer<br/>(Local LLM)
    participant Classifier as Page Classifier<br/>(Local LLM)
    participant Summarizer as Page Summarizer<br/>(Local LLM)
    participant CloudLLM as Page-Graph-Transformer<br/>(Cloud LLM)
    participant Database as Local Database

    %% User action without a participant node
    Note over Extension: User browses a web page

    %% Sequence of interactions
    Extension ->> Personalizer: Generate User Interests
    Personalizer -->> Extension: User Interests
    Extension ->> Classifier: Classify Page vs. User Interests
    Classifier -->> Extension: Relevance Result (Relevant)

    Extension ->> Summarizer: Chunk and Summarize Content
    Summarizer -->> Extension: Summarized Data
    Extension ->> Database: Index Summarized Data
    Extension ->> CloudLLM: Send Minimal Data
    CloudLLM -->> Extension: Return Graph Data
    Extension ->> Database: Store Graph Data
```

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & Security

- **Data Locality:** All raw data processing occurs within your browser using local LLMs and local vector DB.
- **Minimal Cloud Interaction:** Only non-sensitive, aggregated data is sent to the cloud for graph transformations.
- **No Data Sharing:** Your browsing data is never shared with third parties.

## ðŸ“ˆ Roadmap

- [ ] **Conversational Interface:** Build an interactive conversational layer to simplify user interactions.
- [ ] **Artifacts UX:** Enable a side-by-side view of chat and graph for seamless exploration.
- [ ] **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):** Support user-provided keys for LLM providers to offer flexibility and control.
- [ ] **Chrome Web Store Launch:** Officially release BrowseGraph on the Chrome Web Store.
